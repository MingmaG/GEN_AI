It refers to the ability of machines to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. Today, AI is present in almost every aspect of our livesâ€”from using voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, chatbots, and even medical diagnosis systems. The impact of AI is huge and continues to shape how we live, work, and communicate.

One of the biggest advantages of AI is its ability to increase efficiency and productivity. Machines can perform repetitive tasks faster and more accurately than humans. For example, in factories, robots controlled by AI can work continuously without getting tired. In offices, AI tools can help process large amounts of data quickly, allowing people to focus on creative and meaningful work. In healthcare, AI is helping doctors detect diseases earlier and suggest better treatments, which can save lives. Another benefit is that AI systems can make decisions based on data, reducing human error and improving accuracy in various fields.
